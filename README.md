# This script can be tested by going to nutisport.eu, then clicking one of the buttons on the left, then clicking one of the houses and then clicking the button labeled "Alusta".
# The script should be able to change the amount of points you currently have (after clicking "Alusta").
# The script should be able to change the amount of equations you solved which can be seen after the timer has ended or after you pressed "LÃµpeta" whilst the game was ongoing

# The source script for the variables that need to be changed are located (thru inspect element sources tab) in: sisufreim (nutimati.php) -> nutisport.eu -> var17 -> mati -> js -> base2.js
